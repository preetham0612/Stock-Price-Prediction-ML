Final Year Machine Learning Project – Stock Price Prediction
A final-year B.Tech project focusing on stock price prediction using deep learning techniques, particularly LSTM models. This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be applied to predict stock market movements through historical data analysis and pattern recognition.

📊 Stock Price Prediction
Stocks (or equities) represent ownership in a company. When you purchase stock, you effectively own a share of the company’s assets and profits. Stock prices fluctuate daily based on market forces, primarily driven by supply and demand. If demand exceeds supply, prices rise—and vice versa.

While supply and demand are simple concepts, determining what causes investors to favor one stock over another can be complex. Factors like earnings reports, news events, and economic indicators can influence market behavior. Despite efforts to predict price movements, the stock market remains highly volatile and often unpredictable.

📌 Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting stock price trends using technical analysis. Stock market analysis is typically split into two approaches:

Fundamental Analysis: Examines financial statements and external conditions to estimate future profitability.

Technical Analysis: Relies on price charts, historical trends, and statistical patterns.

This project focuses on technical analysis using a Google stock dataset split into training and test data for predictive modeling.
